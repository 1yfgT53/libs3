Create a Library for Handling S3 Requests
-----------------------------------------

Instead of building the S3 functionality directly into the fuses3 tool,
create an S3 library that such a tool would use.

- C library
  - Would like to use C++ but since all the libraries that libs3 would be
    based on are C libraries, it seems useful to make the library a C
    library.  The C++ functionality likely to be used in such a library
    would be minimal anyway.

- Support single requests, and also multiple requests handled by a single
  API.  This would be curl_easy and curl_multi.  This is because it is known
  that some operations (like listing a directory and doing HEAD on each element
  in the directory one by one) will require multiple requests in flight at
  once to be done efficiently.

- Support methods for:

Service operations:

  - listbuckets

Bucket operations:

  - testbucket
  - createbucket
  - deletebucket

ACL operations:

  - setbucketacl
  - addbucketacl
  - removebucketacl
  - clearbucketacl
  - setobjectacl
  - addobjectacl
  - removeobjectacl
  - clearobjectacl

Object operations:

  - putobject
  - copyobject
  - getobject
  - headobject
  - deleteobject

- Configuration

    - http/https
    - bucket
    - pathstyle
    - accesskey
    - securekey
    - user agent info
    - http proxy (someday)
    - network interface (someday)
    - low speed limit (someday)
    - low speed time (someday)

- Miscellaneous

    - All methods will return an error code and will take as an argument
      an optional pointer to an error context to fill out in the event of
      an error, which includes a string description of the error.

    - Data structures defined to represent all structured values passed to
      S3 and returned from S3 (no XML crap)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The API is described in libs3.h.
