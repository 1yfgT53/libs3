Version 1.1 - 2008.10.09
------------------------

	* Added extra compiler warnings and updated code to make it pass
	  these tests
	* Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.0 (not in version 0.7) that
	  caused the last modified date property to not be returned
	* Alter the semantics of the S3PutObjectDataCallback.  Now it is
	  only called enough times to get all of the data that is needed to
	  satisfy the contentLength specified in the S3_put_object call, and
	  only being called with buffers big enough to hold this data.  In
	  other words, the S3PutObjectDataCallback is now only called with
	  "just enough" buffer space to hold the number of bytes that need
	  to be written, as specified by the contentLength parameter of
	  S3_put_object.  Previously, S3PutObjectDataCallback would be
	  called indefinitely until the callback itself returned 0.  This is
	  no longer necessary.
	* Changed the error status code returned when the connection is
	  established but fails before a valid HTTP response header can be
	  received from S3, to S3StatusConnectionFailed; it used to be
	  S3StatusHttpErrorUnknown, but that is more properly reserved for
	  valid HTTP responses that include unknown response codes.
	* S3_runonce_request_context now properly runs until there is no
	  more immediate work to be done on any requests in the context.
	  Previously, it would stop if a callback initiated a new request,
	  and there was no other request with immediate work to do, but it
	  should continue in this case because the new request thus added
	  has immediate work to do.  This allows S3_runall_request_context
	  to function properly and not stop when a request added by a
	  callback has more stuff to do.
	* Some minor documentation updates, and libs3.h now includes
 	  sys/select.h instead of sys/time.h, which is more specific now that
	  time_t is no longer used (as of version 1.0).

[No consistent ChangeLog was kept for previous versions]
